# ðŸŽ‚ Student Birthday Management System

## 1. Overview
This project is a menu-driven Python application that manages student records and identifies students whose birthdays fall on the current date.  
It demonstrates practical usage of Python fundamentals such as:
- Conditional statements  
- Loops  
- Lists & dictionaries  
- File handling  
- Modules (datetime, json, os)  

The project has been designed with real-world software development practices: structured documentation, modular code, and extendable architecture.

## 2. Problem Statement
The system should:
1. Register new students and store their details.  
2. Check if any students have birthdays on the current day.  
3. Display and save todayâ€™s birthday list.  
4. Exit safely when required.  

All records must be persisted in files for future access.

## 3. Core Features (MVP âœ…)
- Register a student with details:
  - Roll Number  
  - Name  
  - Course  
  - Year  
  - Section  
  - Date of Birth (dd-mm-yyyy)  
  - Promise Distribution (custom note)  
- Save each record as a JSON string in students.txt.  
- Birthday check:
  - Compare DOB with todayâ€™s date (day & month).  
  - Print details on screen.  
  - Save results into a new file named as DD-MM-YYYY.txt.  
- Exit the application.

## 4. Future Enhancements (Scalable ðŸš€)
This project is intentionally kept simple but can be extended:
- Update or delete student records.  
- Search by roll number or name.  
- Display all students in a table format.  
- Upcoming birthdays reminder (next 7 days).  
- GUI / Web interface using Streamlit or Flask.  
- Integration with Google Sheets or SQL Database.  
- Dockerized deployment for portability.

## 5. System Design

### 5.1 Data Structure
Each student is stored as a Python dictionary:
```python
{
  "rollno": "1",
  "name": "Amit",
  "course": "MCA",
  "year": "2025",
  "section": "A",
  "dob": "23-09-2002",
  "promise": "Will distribute chocolates ðŸŽ‰"
}
