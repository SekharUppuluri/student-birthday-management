## ðŸ“Œ Problem Statement
A menu-driven Python program to manage student records and check whose birthdays fall on the current date.  
This project demonstrates Python fundamentals including conditionals, loops, dictionaries, file handling, and modules (datetime, json, os).

## ðŸš€ Features (Core Requirements âœ…)
- Register new student with:
  - Roll No, Name, Course, Year, Section, DOB, Promise Note  
- Store all student records in students.txt (JSON format).  
- Check todayâ€™s birthdays:
  - Compare DOB with todayâ€™s date.  
  - Print details on screen.  
  - Save results in a file named DD-MM-YYYY.txt.  
- Exit the program safely.

## ðŸ”® Future Improvements (Scalable ðŸš€)
- Update or delete student records.  
- Search students by Roll Number or Name.  
- Upcoming birthdays reminder (next 7 days).  
- GUI / Web interface using Streamlit or Flask.  
- Integration with Google Sheets or a SQL database.  
- Dockerized deployment for portability.
